## Object-Relational Modeling Practice in Django

Problem description: 
https://cpske.github.io/ISP/assignment/orm/Modeling-Practice.pdf

Write a Sale, LineItem, and Product class in the package `sales`.

For modeling practice, you need only define the attributes (fields),
not the methods.  Use the most appropriate field type and field size,
and specify any useful constraints on the field values.     
Include fields for relationships between objects.

You don't need to write any methods, but if you want to practice
using Django's methods, try writing the methods shown in the UML diagram.
