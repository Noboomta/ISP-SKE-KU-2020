## Auction Testing Problem

Write unit tests for the `Auction` class in `auction.py`.

You should write tests for how the code **should** behave based on the **specification**. Do not test for how this sample code **actually** hehaves.

The sample code may contain errors! 

Documentation is in 2 places:

1. docstring comments in the Auction class
2. online PDF file

If there are any inconsistencies in the two, use the docstring comments.
